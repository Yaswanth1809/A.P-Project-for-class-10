                <h2>Definition of arithmetic progression</h2>
                <p> <strong>An arithmetic progression is a list of numbers in which each term  is
                  obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first term</strong></p>

                <p> This fixed number is called the <strong>common difference</strong> of the AP. Remember that
                        it can be <strong>positive</strong>,<strong>negative</strong> or <strong>zero</strong>.</p>

                <p>  Let us denote the first term of an AP by a<sub>1</sub></p>
                <p>  second term as a<sub>2</sub></p>
                <p>  and so on nth term as a<sub>n</sub> </p>
                <p>  common difference as d</p>
                <p> <strong>Example:</strong>  The heights (in cm) of some students of a school standing in a queue in the
                    morning assembly are 147 , 148, 149, . . ., 157.This is an example of <strong>positive common difference</strong></p>
                <p> <strong>Example:</strong>  The balance money after paying 5 % of the total loan of  1000 every
                    month is 950, 900, 850, 800, . . ., 50...This is an example of <strong>Negative common difference</strong></p>

                <h2>Some Solved Examples for nth Term:</h2>
                <p><strong>Example1:</strong> Find the 10th term of the AP :  2, 7, 12, . . .<br><strong>Solution:</strong> a = 2, d = 7 – 2 = 5 and n =  10<br>a<sub>n</sub>= a + (n – 1) d<br>a<sub>10</sub>= 2 + (10 – 1) × 5 = 2 + 45 = 47</p>
                <p><strong>Example2:</strong> Which term of the AP : 21, 18, 15, . . . is – 81?<br><strong>Solution:</strong> Here, a = 21, d = 18 – 21 = – 3 and a<sub>n</sub>= – 81, and we have to find n.<br> a<sub>n</sub> = a + ( n – 1) d,<br>–81 = 21 + (n – 1)(–3)
                    <br> –81 = 24 – 3n<br>–105 =–3n<br>so  n = 35<br> Therefore, the 35th term of the given AP is –81.</p>
                <p><strong>Example3:</strong> Determine the AP whose 3rd term is 5 and the 7th term is 9.<br><strong>Solution:</strong>  a<sub>3</sub>= a + (3 – 1) d = a + 2d = 5
                    <br> a<sub>7</sub> = a + (7 – 1) d = a + 6d = 9 <br> Solving the pair of linear equations (1) and (2), we get a = 3 and d = 1<br> Hence, the required AP is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . .</p>
                
                <h2>Some solved Examples for sum of n terms:</h2>
                <p><strong>Example1:</strong> Find the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP : 8, 3, –2, . . .<br><strong>Solution:</strong>
                     Here, a = 8, d = 3 – 8 = –5, n = 22 <br>S = (n/2)*[2a + (n - 1)*d]<br>S = (22/2)*[16 + 21(-5)]<br>S = 11[16 - 105]<br>Answer is -979 </p>
                <p><strong>Example2:</strong> If the sum of the first 14 terms of an AP is 1050 and its first term is 10, find the 20th term.
                    <br><strong>Solution:</strong> Here, S<sub>14</sub> = 1050, n = 14, a =10<br>As, S<sub>n</sub> = (n/2)[2a + (n – 1)d]<br>So,<br>1050 = (14/2)[20 + 13d] = 140 + 91d<br>i.e., 910 = 91d<br> d = 10<br>Therefore, a<sub>20</sub> = 10 + (20 – 1) × 10 = 200
                    <br>Hence, 20th term = <strong>200</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Example3:</strong> How many terms of the AP: 24, 21, 18, … must be taken so that their sum is 78?<br><strong>Solution:</strong> Here, a = 24, d = 21 – 24 = –3, S<sub>n</sub> = 78<br>We need to find n.<br>S<sub>n</sub> = (n/2)[2a + (n – 1)d]
                    <br>78 = (n/2)[48 + (n – 1)(–3)]<br>78 = (n/2)[48 – 3n + 3]<br>78 = (n/2)(51 – 3n)<br>156 = n(51 – 3n)<br>3n<sup>2</sup> – 51n + 156 = 0<br>Divide the whole equation by 3:<br>n<sup>2</sup> – 17n + 52 = 0<br>Solving the quadratic:<br>(n – 13)(n – 4) = 0<br> n = 4 or 13
                    <br>Sum becomes 78 for the smaller value<br>Hence, number of terms = <strong>4</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Some Solved Examples for real life applications:</h2>
                <p><strong>Example 1:</strong>A sum of ₹1000 is invested at 8% simple interest per year.Calculate the interest at the end of each year.Do these interests form an AP?If so, find the interest at the end of 30 years making use of this fact.
                    <br><strong>Solution:</strong> We know that the formula to calculate simple interest is:<br>Simple Interest = (P × R × T)/100<br>So, the interest at the end of the 1st year = (1000 × 8 × 1) / 100 = ₹80<br>The interest at the end of the 2nd year = (1000 × 8 × 2) / 100 = ₹160<br>The interest at the end of the 3rd year = (1000 × 8 × 3) / 100 = ₹240
                    <br>Similarly, we can obtain the interest at the end of the 4th year, 5th year, and so on.
                    <br>So, the interest (in ₹) at the end of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, … years, respectively are:<br>80, 160, 240, …<br>It is an AP as the difference between consecutive terms is 80, i.e., d = 80.Also, a = 80.
                    <br>So, to find the interest at the end of 30 years, we calculate a<sub>30</sub>.<br>a<sub>30</sub> = a + (30 – 1)d = 80 + 29 × 80 = 2400<br><strong>Hence, the interest at the end of 30 years is ₹2400.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> In a flower bed, there are 23 rose plants in the first row, 21 in the second, 19 in the third, and so on. There are 5 rose plants in the last row. How many rows are there in the flower bed?
                    <br><strong>Solution:</strong>The number of rose plants in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., rows are : 23, 21, 19, . . ., 5
                    <br>It forms an AP (Why?). Let the number of rows in the flower bed be n.<br>Then, a=23, d = 21–23 = –2,a<sub>n</sub>=5<br>a<sub>n</sub>=a+(n-1)*d<br>5 = 23 + (n – 1)(– 2)<br>– 18 = (n – 1)(– 2)<br>n = 10<br>So, there are 10 rows in the flower bed.</p>

                <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A manufacturer of TV sets produced 600 sets in the third year and 700sets in the seventh year. Assuming that the production increases uniformly by a fixednumber every year, find : 1.The production in the 1st year,2.The production in the 10th year,3.The total production in first 7 years
                    <br><strong>Solution:</strong>1.  Since the production increases uniformly by a fixed number every year,the number of TV sets manufactured in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., years will form an AP.Let us denote the number of TV sets manufactured in the nth year by a<sub>n</sub>.
                    <br>a<sub>3</sub>=600 and a<sub>7</sub>=700 or a + 2d = 600 and a+6d = 700<br>Solving these equations, we get d = 25 and a = 550.<br>Therefore, production of TV sets in the first year is 550.
                    <br>2. a<sub>10</sub> = a+9d = 550+9*25 = 775<br>So, production of TV sets in the 10th year is 775.
                    <br>3. s<sub>7</sub>= 7/2[2*550 + (7-1)*25] = 7/2[1100+150] = 4375<br>Thus, the total production of TV sets in first 7 years is 4375.</p>
